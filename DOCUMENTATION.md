# pyscemu

## initialization

```python
import pyscemu
emu = pyscemu.init32()
or
emu = pyscemu.init64()


    # It is necessary to load the 32bits or 64bits maps folder for having a realistic memory layout.
    # The maps can be downloaded from the https://github.com/sha0coder/scemu
emu.load_maps(folder:str)

    # Load the binary to be emulated.
emu.load_binary(filename:str)
    # Load the bytes to be emulated.
emu.load_code_bytes(bytes:bytearray)
```

optionally is possible to change entry point and base address

```python

    # change the default entry point.
set_entry_point(addr:int)

    # rebase the program address.
set_base_address(addr:int)

```

### hooks 

libscemu provide multipe hooks, but on the python module hooking is experimental for now.

```python

def myhook(eip, mnemonic):
    print(f'{hex(eip)} {mnemonic}')
    if eip >= 0x11223344:
        return False  # stop emulation
    return True


emu.run_hook(myhook)
```
